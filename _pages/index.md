## About me
I am currently a Fellow in Computational Social Science at the Department of Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science. I obtained my PhD in Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences from the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. I will soon join the University of Exeter as Lecturer in Communications and Artificial Intelligence (â‰ˆ tenure-track assistant professor).

I'm interested in Wikipedia, collaborative communities, and news across online platforms. I look to understand the social, editorial, and algorithmic processes that shape collective attention and drive interest towards news and current events. In my research I employ and develop techniques from network science, text analysis, time series analysis, and machine learning.

If you are interested in me and my work do get in touch through email or social media.
