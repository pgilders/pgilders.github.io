## About me
I am a Lecturer (â‰ˆ tenure-track assistant professor) in Communications and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Exeter. I obtained my PhD in Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences from the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford and have also worked as a postdoctoral LSE Fellow in Computational Social Science at the Department of Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science. 

I'm interested in Wikipedia, collaborative communities, and news across online platforms. I look to understand the social, editorial, and algorithmic processes that shape collective attention and drive interest towards news and current events. In my research I employ and develop techniques from network science, text analysis, time series analysis, and machine learning.

At Exeter, I co-direct the [Critical AI Centre](https://cdf.exeter.ac.uk/communications/research/centres/craic/) (CrAIC) and am a member of the management group for the [Institute for Data Science and Artifical Intelligence](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/institutes/idsai/) (IDSAI). I am a Research Affiliate at the [Search Prompt Integrity & Learning Lab](https://www.spillab.com/) (SPILL) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a Visiting Fellow at the [London School of Economics and Political Science Department of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology).

If you are interested in me and my work please do get in touch through email or social media.
