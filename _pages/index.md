## About me
I am a Fellow in Computational Social Science at the Department of Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science. I obtained my PhD in Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences from the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford.

I'm interested in Wikipedia & other collaborative communities, the impact of news, and collective memory, typically using techniques from network science, time series analysis, and machine learning. If you are interested in me and my work do get in touch through email or social media.

## On the job market

I'm currently looking for lecturer / assistant professor level positions broadly related to computational social/communications science. Please get in touch if you think I might be a good fit for your department or have an opportunity to share.
