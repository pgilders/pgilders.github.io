## About me
I am a Lecturer (â‰ˆ tenure-track assistant professor) in Communications and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Exeter. I obtained my PhD in Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences from the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford and have also worked as a postdoctoral LSE Fellow in Computational Social Science at the Department of Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science. 

I'm interested in Wikipedia, collaborative communities, and news across online platforms. I look to understand the social, editorial, and algorithmic processes that shape collective attention and drive interest towards news and current events. In my research I employ and develop techniques from network science, text analysis, time series analysis, and machine learning.

If you are interested in me and my work do get in touch through email or social media.

## Supervision
I am accepting applications for primary supervision and co-supervision of PhD students. If you are interested in working with me, as a first step please consult the information [here](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/pg-research/apply/), and email me an abstract describing your research interests and proposed work.
