Super proud of my MSc supervisees who graduated from LSE last week. All achieved distinctions in their dissertations and degrees, including the top MSc project award! 🎉

Keep an eye out for Flora’s prizewinning project “Measuring the comment gap: A machine learning and quantitative text analysis approach to studying news media user comments” in preprint and publication in the near future 👀
