# Teaching
I am a class teacher across four Masters and PhD level courses at LSE: 'MY470 - Computer Programming', 'MY472 - Data for Data Scientists', 'MY461 - Social Network Analysis', and 'MY452 - Applied Regression Analysis'.

I have worked as a teaching assistant for OII graduate courses 'Introduction to Python', 'Intensive Python', and 'Online Social Networks'. Assignments & model answers available (may be outdated for current courses):
- [Intensive Python](https://github.com/pgilders/OII-PySDS-ModelAnswers)
- Others Forthcoming
